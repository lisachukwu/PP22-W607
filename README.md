# Air Quality in Madrid (2001-2018)
# Different pollution levels in Madrid from 2001 to 2018

This dataset is created out of the frustation of how inconvenient and irregular the historical data was provided in the Open Data website. It contains in a practical format 18 years (2001-2018) of hourly data in just a single file, which makes this dataset a great playground for time series analysis and other prediction tasks. How do different gases correlate their levels? Are there any changes in trends? Can they be mapped to the recent decisions made by the city council, or do they relate to rainy dates? What is the best model to predict pollution levels? How do the levels interpolate between the location of the stations? Are some gases more common at different elevations?
